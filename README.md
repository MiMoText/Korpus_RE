# Project MiMoText
Readme created on May 16th by Katharina Dietz

This package contains code to create a corpus from secondary literature.
The texts are cleaned, then vectorized.
Classification Task: Determine wether a relation between entities consists.

--------------------------
### Lucky's TODOS:
- [x] Group project files into "pipes" for overview (roughly)
- [x] First ReadMe Update
- [ ] Work on task from first week of June, use functions which are already implemented (grouping task should help with that)
- [ ] create new main.py file
- [ ] Test if scripts do what they supposed to
- [ ] Take a good look at the "pipes", maybe even update ReadMe accordingly
- [ ] If neccesary, research design patterns/packaging
- [ ] If neccesary, ask questions @ leadership
- [ ] Update TODOs & ReadMe
